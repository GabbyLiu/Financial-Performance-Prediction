# Portfolio Optimization Platform using Machine Learning Models

## Financial Models for Portfolio Optimization
To approach the optimzation problem of achieving a higher return while lower risk, we go back to these classic models:<br>
Black-Litterman Model <br>
Markowitz Model<br>
Hierachical risk parity

## View Matrix and Uncertainty Matrix Generation
We used three types of models to generate the best **view matrix** and **uncertainty matrix** for Black-Litterman Model.

We picked **stock price return** as the proxy for the two matrices mentioned above.

### Expected Return Prediction:
1. Statistical Finance Models: ARIMA, GARCH
2. Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
3. Neural Network Model: Monte Carlo Dropout
